    <p>
        Hello, I'm Kyle! I've worked as a colour theory researcher for HCI applications, and I've worked on
        developing/researching parallelizable classical ML pipelines for NLP and other forms of quantitative analysis. I
        am deeply passionate about computer graphics, machine learning, and real-time application/systems design.

        This website makes use of HTML, CSS, JS, and WebGPU. Not a single framework or package was used in the making of
        this website. My site is a hyper-responsive 1 page web application that renders millions of particles in
        real-time on desktop and mobile devices. The desktop site renders 4 million particles, while the mobile site
        renders 1 million particles instead. Both versions easily meet their respective display refresh rates on
        standard consumer hardware.

        Although my site does not use any frameworks, I still have plenty of experience using React and Svelte. I have
        used both frameworks to develop web applications and have experience with server-side rendering, static site
        generation, and single-page applications.
