    <p>
        Hello, I'm Kyle! I'm a M.Sc. CS grad student researching colour and light for HCI applications at the University of Guelph.
        During my undergrad I had the opportunity to work on developing/researching parallelizable classical ML pipelines for NLP and other forms of quantitative analysis.
        I am deeply passionate about computer graphics, machine learning, and real-time application/systems design.

        This website makes use of HTML, CSS, JS, and WebGPU. It is a hyper-responsive 1 page web application that renders 
        millions of particles in real-time on desktop and mobile devices. The desktop site renders 4 million particles, 
        while the mobile site renders 1 million particles instead. Both versions easily meet their respective display 
        refresh rates on standard consumer hardware. Devices that don't support WebGPU will not render the particles, but 
        will still display the rest of the site.

        Although my site does not use any frameworks, I still have plenty of experience using React and Svelte. I have
        used both frameworks to develop web applications and have experience with server-side rendering, static site
        generation, and single-page applications.
